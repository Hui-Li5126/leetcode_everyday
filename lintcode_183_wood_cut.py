Description
Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces 
with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small 
pieces.

Example 1:
Input:
L = [232, 124, 456]
k = 7
Output: 114
Explanation: We can cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 114cm long, however we can't cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 115cm long.

Example 2:
Input:
L = [1, 2, 3]
k = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: It is obvious we can't make it.
