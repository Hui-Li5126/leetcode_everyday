Description
Given a matrix of lower alphabets and a dictionary. Find all words in the dictionary that can be found in the matrix. A word can start from 
any position in the matrix and go left/right/up/down to the adjacent position. One character only be used once in one word. No same word 
in dictionary

Example
Example 1:

Input：["doaf","agai","dcan"]，["dog","dad","dgdg","can","again"]
Output：["again","can","dad","dog"]
Explanation：
  d o a f
  a g a i
  d c a n
search in Matrix，so return ["again","can","dad","dog"].
Example 2:

Input：["a"]，["b"]
Output：[]
Explanation：
 a
search in Matrix，return [].
Challenge
Using trie to implement your algorithm.
