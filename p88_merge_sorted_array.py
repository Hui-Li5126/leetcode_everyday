Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively. 
You may assume that nums1 has a size equal to m + n such that it has enough space to hold additional elements from 
nums2.

        p1 = m - 1

        # And move p backwards through the array, each time writing
        # the smallest value pointed at by p1 or p2.
        for p in range(n + m - 1, -1, -1):
            if p2 < 0:

            else:
                nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
                p2 -= 1
